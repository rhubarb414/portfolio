# Portfolio Page

## Description

This is a basic portfolio page started in week 2 of the bootcamp. As I deploy new projects, I can add them here and have a professional portfolio to serve me in my job search.

Building it was a test of my HTML and CSS skills so far, especially when it comes to positioning and flexbox.

I built it using flexbox, as that is what we learned in class. However, I've looked at grid layout on my own time and I feel that would have given me more control and predictability. I look forward to trying grid layout in the future.

## Usage

On screens larger 768px, the site should resemble this screenshot:

This site includes a media call for screens 768px and below, in which case it will resemble the following screenshot:
